# copulamrf
This repository contains MATLAB implementation of the algorithm proposed in our paper titled as "A copula based approach for design of multivariate random forests for drug sensitivity prediction"



The copula and MRF parameters are as follows in Main.m:



n_tree: number of trees in the forest

mtree: number of random features selected at each node in each tree

F: For F fold cross validation

min_leaf: criteria for stopping splitting



To run the code, simply do the following:


1. Open Main.m

2. Change MRF or Copula parameters

3. Run it



The results are found from other variables inside Main.m which is self explanatory
